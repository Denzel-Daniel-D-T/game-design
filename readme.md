### Character:

**Dienia Elei Myssilia:** A master swordswoman and well versed in the art of Tenebrae, she is heir to the Myssilia Clan and the royal army's first line of defense in infiltration missions. (Main Character)

**Aselien Lumia Myssilia:** Dienia's sister, she handles logistics and other background tasks whenever required. Seemingly innocent, her skill in balancing Ordo and Lux makes her a deadly adversary to those foolish enough to threaten her planet's prosperity.

**Dyminexus Arteixin Zemistrion:** The last heir of a mysterious species' clan. After losing his home planet to an even more mysterious malignant entity, he has wandered the galaxy, looking for a place to call home again, and has settled in Planet Mystosa after a long journey.
	
**Chronoxystel Dextrion Alystrein:** A relatively young descendant of a certain mysterious species, seemingly serving Aeon Flux as one of his generals. Has a strong sense of duty and justice. Maybe if you can convince him to see Aeon Flux's atrocities, you might be able to get him to help Planet Mystosa...

### Key Points of Interest:
- Extensive world with many backgrounds, where each structure has their own history written out.
	- eg. A side quest revolves around the history of a certain location, meanwhile the history of a long lost civilization might be contained within a single item.
- Extensive elemental combat system, where each attack can have elements infused into them.
- Environmental objects can be destroyed with certain elements, and might drop unique items depending on the elements used.

### Action:
- Interact with NPCs (Non Player Characters)
- Pick up items
- Enter/Exit building
- Break objects
- Crafting/Forging
- Upgrade Equipment
- Upgrade Skills
- Fight enemies

### Complexity:
- Multiple simultaneous playable character
	- Switch from one character to another, with a cooldown; uncontrolled characters use an AI.
- Story heavy (already planned out)
- 4/5 chapters
- Elemental combat system
	- So far, 12 static element and 1 transient element exists
	- Elemental Reactions:

		- Volatile Reactions (eg. Ignis + Ordo = Potentia)
- Collision

### Story Synopsis:
The peaceful Planet Mystosa has fallen under an invasion by Aeon Flux, where he seeks to extract the planet’s resources for reasons unknown. As the heir of the prestigious Myssilia Clan, Dienia Elei Myssilia, you shall help the planet escape from the brink of destruction.

With a diverse elemental system consisting of 12 + 1 elements, take back Planet Mystosa’s prosperity from Aeon Flux’s avarice grip by mastering the elemental reactions to defeat his henchmen, and also help out your fellow Mystosans on their way to recovery from the invasion.

### Description:
As the player, you can control various characters and use their skills to aid in protecting the planet. Each character usually masters one element out of the twelve existing elements, however, exceptions exist. Each character can infuse such elements into their weapon of choice, fashion their own weapon made out of pure elemental energy, or even conjure the pure elemental energy into waves of energy to directly attack their targets.

Once you meet other characters, you can start causing elemental reactions to happen, which can have various effects depending on which element was applied first.

Materials are the backbone of most of the game’s systems. They are key components in the various features like crafting, forging, upgrading equipment, and many more.

Materials can come from many sources, including gathering them from the wild, buying them from shops, crafting them from other raw materials, or even dropped by the various enemies that inhabit the planet, be it Aeon Flux’s underlings or the natural fauna.

Crafting allows the player to synthesize stronger materials from lesser ones, or even create nifty gadgets that help the player explore the planet or fight enemies.

Forging allows the player to create their own weapons, with various advantages unique to crafted weapons, including higher base stats, lighter weight, and even unique effects.

Breakable objects are scattered throughout the planet. Each breakable object may require certain elemental attacks to break them. When broken, they can drop various materials, and with the right elemental combinations, some objects may even drop materials found nowhere else.

Upgrading equipment requires uncommon materials dropped by enemies and breaking objects with certain elemental combinations. Upgrading equipment grants them new abilities and effects.

Upgrading the character’s skills and talents require rare materials dropped by tough enemies found throughout the story, and very rare materials only dropped by minerals originating from the hardest to reach areas of the planet.
