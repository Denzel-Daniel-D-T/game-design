Description:
	As the player, you can control various characters and use their skills to aid in protecting the planet. Each character usually masters one element out of the twelve existing elements, however, exceptions exist. Each character can infuse such elements into their weapon of choice, fashion their own weapon made out of pure elemental energy, or even conjure the pure elemental energy into waves of energy to directly attack their targets.

	Once you meet other characters, you can start causing elemental reactions to happen, which can have various effects depending on which element was applied first.

	Materials are the backbone of most of the game’s systems. They are key components in the various features like crafting, forging, upgrading equipment, and many more.

	Materials can come from many sources, including gathering them from the wild, buying them from shops, crafting them from other raw materials, or even dropped by the various enemies that inhabit the planet, be it ____ ____’s underlings or the natural fauna.

	Crafting allows the player to synthesize stronger materials from lesser ones, or even create nifty gadgets that help the player explore the planet or fight enemies.

	Forging allows the player to create their own weapons, with various advantages unique to crafted weapons, including higher base stats, lighter weight, and even unique effects.

	Breakable objects are scattered throughout the planet. Each breakable object may require certain elemental attacks to break them. When broken, they can drop various materials, and with the right elemental combinations, some objects may even drop materials found nowhere else.

	Upgrading equipment requires uncommon materials dropped by enemies and breaking objects with certain elemental combinations. Upgrading equipment grants them new abilities and effects.

	Upgrading the character’s skills and talents require rare materials dropped by tough enemies found throughout the story, and very rare materials only dropped by minerals originating from the hardest to reach areas of the planet.
